*There needs to be at least one CORE-V CORES committer already elected who can review and merge pull requests on the project repos. 



## Work Breakdown Structure


*The project work is broken down starting from high level to low level.*
- *At high level, work can be broken down by technical component, project phase, area of focus or other method.*
- *At low level, specific tasks are enumerated with estimated time durations (e.g. 1 person for 2 weeks)* 
- *If appropriate, tasks are assigned to individuals*
- *For agile projects, tasks can be assigned to individuals during project execution. If so, initial task backlog without assignment to individual can be created.*
- *Format of the WBS can be github project board, spreadsheet, or other*.

- *Examples to be provided in a future version*


## Schedule
*A timeline view is created by considering the WBS breakdown, dependencies among tasks, resource availability, and schedule requirements. The format of the timeline view can be github project board with milestones, a spreadsheet, or gantt chart.*

- *The schedule should indicate the planned date of major milestones and the first release for the project*
- *Remaining uncertainties or issues to be resolved should be described*
- *How the schedule will be maintained following PA should be described*

- *Examples to be provided in a future version*

## Project Repo 
*The project repo(s) should be setup and listed here*
*The repos should have README.MD and LICENSE.MD created*
*The LICENSE.MD file should specify the project license*

## Regular Project Meeting 
*The project should have a regular project meeting established and included on the OpenHW calendar. Send a recurring meeting request to meetings@openhwgroup.org*

## Regular Project Report
*The project should have a regular project meeting report agreed. The format of the report should follow the suggestion in the programs/template repo. Consult OpenHW staff as meeting report location*.
